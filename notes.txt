// CPT2 notes and proposals

NetListNew.h, PartListNew.h, and TextListNew.h contain evolving notes on which functions
are slated for moving into classes for lower-level objects (like cseg2, cnet2, etc.)

Functions that contain code that won't yet compile (still need translation into the new
idiom) are marked off with #ifndef CPT2.  The goal is to bring these back to life bit by bit.

I would propose that CFreePcbView::CancelSelection() always turn off net highlighting by default.  If caller really wants to rehighlight
afterwards (I don't think that will be frequent), let 'em do it by hand.

I am trying a new system for thermals, where their drawing objects get associated not with areas but with individual vertices/tees/pins.
As a result the old routines carea2::SetConnections, cnet2::SetAreaConnections and the like can be phased out.  cvertex2::SetNeedsThermal,
cpin2::SetNeedsThermal, cnet2::SetThermals, cnetlist::SetThermals, and cpartlist::SetThermals can take their place.

While translating CFreePcbView::OnPartDelete(), I grappled with the distinction between CNetList::PartDeleted() and 
CNetList::PartDisconnected() --- hard for me to figure out.  The former
seems to leave in place notional pins within nets that refer to parts no longer in existence.  I'm not convinced that 
having these is terribly useful, and I can imagine them causing confusion or puzzling program behavior down the road.
Therefore I'm proposing a different distinction that I think might be more helpful:  when deleting a part, user can choose whether or not to destroy
all the traces that emanate from that part.  If no, then there will be stub traces that terminate in the positions where the vanished pins used to be 
(might be useful if, say, user decides to trade out one kind of header for another, a trade that might leave the board's traces mostly unchanged).
If yes, then the behavior will be similar to what we had before.  But in no case will there be phantom pins on non-existent parts.

Reorganized class CShape a little: m_ref and m_value are now ctexts (formerly they were CTexts);  all the m_ref_xi, m_ref_angle, ... members 
are now down within the m_ref object;  similarly for the m_value_xi, ... members.

I am adjusting classes pad and padstack so that the latter in particular becomes part of the new class hierarchy, and both have associated
drawing-elements.  This will be useful when converting the footprint editor UI;  instead of using cpin2's to represent pins, as happens in the main
view, padstacks will represent the pins user sees.
In honor of this change I'm renaming pad to cpad and padstack to cpadstack.  (Helps me ensure that I've converted things that need converting.)

To do later: just as functions in CNetList and CPartList are getting moved into classes for lower-level objects, I think various functions
can be moved out of CDisplayList into dl_element and its descendants (will require adding a dlist pointer to class dl_element).

Latest-n-greatest proposal for drawing/undrawing.  I've grown dissatisfied with my previous system for drawing and undrawing, so here's another
pass at it, hopefully this time a winner.  When a low-level routine is going to make changes to an object 
in the cpcb_item hierarchy, it should first call either
object->Undraw(), in the event that the object is being removed forever, or object->MustRedraw(), 
in the event that it or its membership is only being modified.  The latter routine itself calls object->Undraw(), and then adds the
object to the carray object->doc->redraw.  After all modifications are finished, the outer-level routine (CFreePcbDoc::OnLButtonUp, say) should then
call doc->Redraw().  That routine runs through all the objects in doc->redraw, and after double-checking their validity, draws 'em.

Notice also that the behavior of Draw() for individual classes is slightly different now too (other than in the case of cconnect2::Draw and
cnet2::Draw, which as before simply hand off to Draw() for constituent items).  For the other, lower-level classes (including cpolyline and cpart), 
Draw() first checks the bDrawn flag, and if it's already drawn, it _simply returns_.  This works because before objects are modified they will already
have been undrawn by cpcb_item::MustRedraw().  In the event that (say) both a net and one of its constituent segments get added to CFreePcbDoc::redraw, 
a real possibility, we save effort by just bailing out during CFreePcbDoc::Redraw's second attempt to draw the segment.

I've now generalized the routines subordinate to the former carea2::PolygonModified;  they now work on any cpolyline.  So without hesitation I'm 
invoking this new cpolyline::PolygonModified() each time user edits a sm-cutout.  I could readily do this for board outlines too, but I admit I'm 
not entirely sure if this is desirable (my inexperience with PCB fabrication shows...).   Is it the case that user might want to have two board outlines 
that share a common edge?  If so, then we don't want any sort of fancy merging of cboard polylines...

Observe that the f-key menus for copper areas, sm-cutouts, and board-outlines have now become more consistent.  Also
note that the nomenclature from the user's perspective has changed a little now that one can do everything with sm-cutout polylines that one can do
with copper areas.  Instead of "adding a cutout" to an area or sm-cutout (the latter particularly confusing), the bottom pane of f-keys now says
"F7 exclude region."  If one selects a corner/side of a hole, the command for removing the hole is no longer "F7 delete cutout" but 
"F7 remove contour."

Previously when CShapes were created they were very frequently constructed with m_doc NULL.  This has been causing various headaches when switching
into the footprint editor, so I'm trying now to get these m_doc members setup to match the doc fields of all the pcb-items on the board.  In a somewhat
related change, I'm changing CFootprintView::m_fp to a pointer, which makes it easier to set up its m_doc member properly with a constructor.
We'll see how well all this pans out down the line...

NB drawing and undrawing are simpler in the footprint editor than in the main editor.  Just 
undraw the whole footprint, make whatever changes, then redraw the whole footprint.
That first step can often be omitted if no objects are getting detached from the fp, because CEditShape::Draw() calls Undraw() first by default.

I've attempted to improve the behavior of right-clicking.  Now a right-click will select an appropriate object right away, without having to do a 
left-click first.  See CCommonView::RightClickSelect().

Terminological proposal:  I'm developing the opinion that the UI should use "connect"/"connection" to mean
a linear succession of vertices/segs, and "trace" to mean the opposite of "ratline" (i.e., a routed seg).  I've taken the liberty of
altering UI elements accordingly, and am now offering the 'C' key as an alternate to 'T'.

Some examples of information flow:

	- when starting the application:
		- a CDisplayList is created
		- a CPartList is created
		- a CNetList is created
		- pointers to the CDisplayList and CNetList are passed to the CPartList
		- pointers to the CDisplayList and CPartList are passed to the CNetList
			
	- when opening a project:
		- the project file is read
		- all cparts are added to the CPartList (see below) 
		- all cnets are added to the CNetList (see below)
			
	- when adding a part:
		- a cpart is created
		- if the footprint of the part doesn't already exist in the design, it is
			imported from a library and a CShape created
		- a pointer to the CShape is passed to the cpart
		- the cpart is added to CPartList
		- CPartList draws the part by adding its graphic elements to the display list
		- each graphic element is identified by the id of the part
		- CDisplayList draws the graphic elements on the screen, thereby drawing the
			part
		- graphic elements drawn to the SELECTION layer are usually invisible, and
			are used for selecting parts (see below)

	- when the user selects a part by clicking the mouse button:
		- the cursor position is passed to CDisplayList::TestSelect(), which searches 
			for a corresponding graphic element on the SELECTION layer (these 
			elements will generally be invisible)
		- if a graphic element is found at the cursor position, its id is passed back
			to the calling program which can use it to identify the item represented
			by the graphic element
 
 

CPT revisions:
1. m_active_width added to CFreePcbView.  Permits adjustment
    of width during routing.  There are coordinated changes in the system of via widths.  
2. Got rid of the OPENFILENAME_SIZE_VERSION_400 business in calls to 
	CFileDialog::CFileDialog().  (Produced "Assertion failed" errors, at least under Visual studio 10.)
2a. In CUR_END_VTX_SELECTED mode, changed the
    original assignment of F2 when the vertex is a via (was FK_ADD_SEGMENT, now FK_VIA_SIZE)
3. Shortcut keys: Ctrl F1..., Ctrl 1..., Alt 1...  NB undo is now ctrl-shift-z (ctrl-y would toggle layer #13 or some such)
4. Changed shift-key and ctrl-key state detection.
5. Tools>Preferences.  Starting to move some config elements to the Registry (desirable?)
6. Since MS broke CFileDialog::SetTemplates(), changed the import netlist and export netlist options dialogs.
7. Moved strings into Resource string table.
8. Allowed adaptible widths for items in MyToolBar, the left pane, and the F-key
	help boxes.  (For use by people doing foreign language adaptations with Resource Hacker)
9. Added a project folder selection button to DlgProjectOptions
10.  Altered DlgLayers.  Now allows for control of the colors in the FootprintView (they match the main view colors, 
	except for the layers that are footprint-specific --- those latter get extra rows in the DlgLayers table).  Allowed
	for setting a color scheme to be used by default in future projects (vals stored in the registry).
11. Fixed bugs with the display of new (empty) documents.
12. Added reference-text-visibility control to DlgAddPart.  Fixed bug where ref text visibility came out randomly when
	copying and pasting.
13. "/" key for toggle units.  "?" for toggle units plus change grid units.  Tweaked FreePcbView::OnChangeUnits().
14. New system for modifying grid values (View>Visible Grid Values, etc.).  Completed conversion over from 
	default.cfg to the registry for all program-wide prefs (for new projects e.g.).  Added checkbox to Project>Options
	to make settings default.  Moved some stuff to Tools>Preferences.

...TortoiseSVN commit by Allan, revision 238

14a. Info related to default new-project settings _no longer_ in the registry, but stored in default.cfg.
15. Modified group-selection behavior, so that there is no longer a distinction between a group of 1 element and a single selected
	item.  To prevent any lost functionality, implemented arrow keys for board edges, area edges, sm-cutouts, and end-vertices; implemented
	ctrl-c/x for single selected items.
15a.  FORGOT TO LIST THIS ONE PREVIOUSLY.  Fixed bug where SetCapture() was not called in CFreePcbView::OnLButtonDown(), causing
	poor behavior when dragging and releasing outside the client area.  Moreover, now allows autoscrolling when dragging a group-select 
	rectangle out to the margins.
16. Added sorting to export netlist.
17. Removed restriction on pin names (before, 1A and A1A were illegal)
18. During connect-to-pin-to-create-ratline mode (CUR_DRAG_NEW_RAT), the status bar now shows the name of the pin where mouse is hovering.
19. After creating such a ratline, it is selected by default.
20. When moving groups/parts, don't unroute an adjacent seg if, say, the group is moving vertically and the seg is vertical (changes in e.g.
   	CNetList::UnrouteSegment() and CNetList::UnrouteSegmentWithoutMerge())
21. When routing a ratline provide highlighting for the opposite end of the ratline
22. Tweaked behavior of ctrl-up/dn (they now change whichever grid is currently relevant --- routing grid if net object is selected, placement
     grid otherwise).  Alt-up/dn now controls the visible grid.
23. Made a start towards ratline elimination in case the ratline's two endpoints are already connected by some sort of copper route
     (including connects and/or areas).  Can't yet create traces where neither end is a pin (see TestC.fpc for an example where this would be
	 nice).
24. Suppressed DRC width errors for segments in the ratline layer.
25. Fixed bug with random ref text visibility after importing netlists.

...TortoiseSVN commit, version 244

25a. Fix 25 (random ref text visibility after importing netlist bug) didn't quite do it;  bug should now be smashed!
26. Fixed bug where SetFKText wasn't reliably called when starting up the footprint editor (see CFootprintView constructor)
27. obparham's idea: boxes for grabbing vertices are no longer a constant size in mils (in pixel terms, they are a minimum of 6 pixels wide/high
	and a maximum of 16 pixels wide/high).
28. Bug fix in ReadFileLines() (FreePcbDoc.cpp) (related to feature #14a).
29. Fixed bug in feature #20 (wasn't implemented when moving parts with the mouse).
30. Created CPartList::CheckBrokenArea():  checks if an area has been broken, or nearly broken, by clearances for traces from other nets.  TODO: 
	make it accommodate areas with curved edges.
31.  THE BIGGIE:  created class CCommonView as a base for CFootprintView and CFreePcbView.  Moved shared functions into it.  Added functionality to
	footprint editor to make it more consistent with the main editor, including:  selection masks; hotkeys for layers and masks;
	arrow keys with dx/dy status display;  status bar when pin & outline-corner selected has become more informative (shows x/y);  
	status bar shows dx/dy when dragging pins, text, ref-text, etc.
32. Reworked the internal handling of the ref-text and value-text objects in footprint editor.  They are now basically instances of CText, 
	meaning we can rely on that class's preexisting functions and eliminate some more-or-less-duplicate code.
33. Modified behavior of CFootprintView::OnViewEntireFootprint() to account better for ref and value text.

...TortoiseSVN commit, version 246

34. Resolved apparent bug in CNetList::ClipAreaPolygon() (a commented-out "if"-clause, now restored).  Was causing insertion of corner into area
	edges to fail if new vertex was collinear with pre-existing vertices.
35. Continuation of #30: CPartList::CheckBrokenArea() now accounts for curved area edges.

...TortoiseSVN commit, version 247

36. Added left-handed mode support (reverses function keys).   Activate it via Tools>Preferences.
37. Fixed CText constructor (dl_sel member wasn't prveviously initialized).  Caused problems when one called CShape::m_value->Undraw()
	in cases where CShape::m_value->Draw() hadn't previously been called (because CShape::m_value_size was 0, say)
38. A little clean-up for CShape::CreateMetaFile() & CreateWarningMetaFile() (evidently pretty old code).
39. (Basically a continuation of #33 earlier.)  Improvements to the new CText::GetBounds().  Before it would fail for text that had 
	never been drawn, implying in turn bogus results from
	FootprintView::OnViewEntireFootprint() when first starting the fp editor.  Also: improved system for initializing the new 
	CShape::m_ref and CShape::m_value.  (Constructor does more of the work, as it should.)
40. In FootprintView, forbade setting ref-text height to 0 --- doing that caused "REF" to shrink down to a useless dot that a later user 
    couldn't select or repair   If users want invisible ref-text, I say they can do it when inserting the part into the board.
	Considered making the same prohibition for value-text, but instead I'm implementing "View>Reveal Value Text" (CFootprintView::OnValueReveal())
	in case user wants to restore a	size-0 "VALUE" (formerly impossible to do short of hacking the fpl file).  
	This supplants the old apparently disused CFootprintView::OnAddValueText() function.
41. Slight change to selection masks in footprint editor.
42. Got ESC key working better in footprint editor.

...TortoiseSVN commit, version 248

43.  Fixed 'N' key so that it selects a net if a ratline was previously selected.  Also turned 'N' into a toggle key, so that pressing it twice takes 
	us back to the prior selection.
44.  Similar changes for 'T' (which selects individual traces)
45. New system for selecting.  (See CDisplayList::TestSelect(), and the new CCommonView::m_sel_offset.)  If user repeatedly clicks on a spot where 
	multiple objects are located, the selection cycles through all of them.  Ctrl-click in the main CFreePcbView is also affected:  if you ctrl-click 
	a spot in order to select or unselect a group member, and don't get the effect you want, keep holding ctrl and clicking until you do.
46. Improved TestLineHit() in utility.cpp so that we get more reliable results (on short segments particularly).  

...TortoiseSVN commit, version 249
