Bugs and comments
-----------------
- doesn't handle missing default.cfg file properly, if default.cfg not present, empty file created which then fails to load
- ? synching with netlist file: this seems like overkill, could just add option to remove footprint from part, without deleting part (this should be available anyway)
- should go back to calling openings in copper areas "cutouts"
- probably shouldn't automatically end stub trace with a via
- when opening footprint editor with part selected, and then exiting without changing the footprint, should not be 
prompted to save or replace footprint
- should expand function keys to include F10-F12, change left-hand option to use them
- ? re-enable pin-swapping (probably wasn't used much, but nice if you need it)
- when pasting a group where copper areas overlap, they are not merged.
- should add option to add "free vias", i.e. a connection consisting of a single via.
- also add option of "free trace"
- when moving a part, segments connecting to pins shouldn't be unrouted (or make this an option) - same when moving group
- there are some changes in the code that depend on parts never having a NULL footprint
- FileSaveAs sometimes fails in debug version if file name doesn't already exist
- DRC crashes
- need to add DRC check for text and polylines on the copper layers of the PCB
- need to ad DRC check for copper text in footprints
- should add warning when pressing F4 with pin selected, offer to move part instead
- flashing window when resizing is annoying
- when moving a trace segment between ratlines, ? should not be constrained by ratlines as if they were routed segments
- nice feature to show direction of selected trace segments or polygon sides when shift-clicked, could be improved by using graphic line instead of "-|/|" characters
- when saving project, all preferences are not saved (eg. not including polygon sides in selected group)

Actions
-------
Fixed - incompatibility with version 1.2 project files
Fixed - no "thermals" shown for SMT pads
Fixed - "thermals" now shown for all vertices that connect to copper areas (not just vias)
Changed - restored use of m_parent_folder on creating new project
Fixed - footprint layer colors not initialized properly (didn't include bottom silk)
Fixed - footprint text and polys now made invisible when dragging part
Changed - disabled using location of default.cfg from registry (see above)
In progress - don't unroute segments when moving part
Fixed - CPin::pad_layer was not updated when part changed sides, replaced it with CPin::GetLayer()
Fixed - memory leak in CShape::Clear()
Changed - when a part is moved, connected traces are not unrouted unless part changes side
Changed - garbage collection is now called on exiting the program
Fixed - when clicking on a vertex, the vertex should be selected before the adjacent segments
Fixed - similarly, when clicking on a polygon corner, the corner should be selected before the adjacent sides
In progress - adding calls to SetThermals() and OptimizeConnections() for all editing operations that change them
