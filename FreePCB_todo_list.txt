I'm restarting this TODO list on July 11, 2012
----------------------------------------------

TODO
----

-	when clicking on a vertex with connected segments, the segments get selected first
	which is very annoying
-	DRC not working
-	DRC needs to be updated to check copper text and graphics
-	many improvements are needed to footprint editor
-	when routing a trace and clicking on a vertex or segment of another trace,
	there should be a dialog to confirm connection, for pins just connect with no dialog
-	View->Find_Part should offer to center on part, or start moving it in the current viewport
-	need to update User Guide
-	put layer translation tables back in for backwards compatibility


To think about
--------------

-	don't unroute traces when moving a part
-	add bDrawn flag to items to control redrawing
-	similarly, add flags for setting area connections and optimizing connections
-	reorganize handling of events in FreePCBView depending on state
