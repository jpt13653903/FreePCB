I'm restarting this TODO list on July 11, 2012
----------------------------------------------

BUGS
----
-	need to clean up code for moving tee-vertex with via
-	routing angle not initialized on starting program
-	when deleting group, some ratlines remain
-	SetAreaConnections() not called on every edit	
-	CFileDialog not working properly in Windows 7
-	DRC not working
-	DRC needs to be updated to check copper text and graphics
-	many improvements are needed to footprint editor
-	when routing a trace and clicking on a vertex or segment of another trace,
	there should be a dialog to confirm connection, for pins it is OK to connect with no dialog
-	View->Find_Part should offer to center on part, or start moving it in the current viewport
-	need to update User Guide
-	put layer translation tables back in for backwards compatibility
-	Project Options should set project folder (as before)
-	CAM dialog should warn if CAM folder not in Project folder

FIXED
-----
-	toggling mm/mil doesn't work
-	cursor x, y could exceed -32 to 32 inch range
-	when clicking on a vertex with connected segments, the segments get selected first
	which is very annoying
-	ditto for corners of polygons
-	F-keys to inc/dec width and grid don't work when routing stub trace

OTHER ITEMS
-----------
-	add bDrawn flag to items to control redrawing
